# Incident-Handling-Risk-Assessment-and-Compliance-Auditing

<br><br>

## Objective
  <p>
    To apply expertise in network traffic analysis, incident response, and cybersecurity auditing 
    to identify, mitigate, and prevent security threats. Seeking to strengthen organizational security 
    posture by leveraging hands-on experience while aligning with industry best practices and frameworks 
    such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, PCI DSS, and GDPR.
